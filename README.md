# Stock Market Trends Prediction Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

This project explores the prediction of stock market trends using a combination of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms. It provides a comparative analysis of predictive performance using both continuous and binary data to evaluate how different approaches perform in real-world financial forecasting.

## Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles raw stock market data, including cleaning, feature engineering, and normalization.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Evaluates the performance of ML algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, SVM) versus DL models (e.g., LSTM, CNN).
- **Predictive Modeling**: Predicts stock market trends, such as upward or downward movements, using binary and continuous data formats.
- **Visualization**: Provides insightful visualizations to demonstrate trends, predictions, and model performance.

## Tech Stack:
- **Languages**: Python
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn
- **Deep Learning**: TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Data Sources**: Historical stock market data from sources such as Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage.
